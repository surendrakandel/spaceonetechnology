# API reference

Same-origin JSON API under `/api`. All mutations require an `Origin` header matching the request origin. Browser clients use the HttpOnly `space_session` cookie. JSON requests use `Content-Type: application/json`; uploads use multipart `FormData`. Errors return `{ "message": "…" }` with 400/401/403/404/409/410/413/429 as appropriate. Unexpected errors return a request ID. Never put session credentials in URLs.

`C` means signed-in users accessing their own data. `S` means staff or admin. `A` means admin only. `P` means public.

## Account access

| PATCH  | `/me`                      | C      | `name,timezone`; optional `phone,headline,location,bio,skills` (string array) |

Passwords require 12–128 characters. Roles and account status cannot be changed through signup or profile updates. Public signup creates clients only. Invitation and reset secrets are stored as hashes.

## Jobs and applications

| Method     | Endpoint                 | Access      | Behavior                                                                                 |
| ---------- | ------------------------ | ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| GET        | `/jobs`                  | C           | Jobs visible to current user, own status, interview summary, aggregate application count |

| POST       | `/jobs/{id}/resume`      | C           | `{file_id}` copies a profile PDF into immutable job resume history                       |
| POST       | `/jobs/{id}/interviews`  | C           | Interview payload below                                                                  |

Staff/admin can add `?candidate={clientId}` to a job, application, note, comment, upload, resume-copy, interview-create, task, or profile-library request. The server validates that the subject is a client and requires operator access. Clients cannot select another user. Operators may read/update candidate interview and file resources by ID; clients remain restricted to their own records.

Statuses: `to_apply`, `saved`, `applied`, `processing`, `interview`, `offer`, `rejected`, `withdrawn`. `saved` boolean is an independent bookmark. Version conflicts return 409; refresh before retrying. `follow_up` is an ISO calendar date or null; `applied_at` is a UTC ISO timestamp or null. Moving to an applied/processing/interview/offer/rejected state records an applied date if absent, unless a valid explicit timestamp is supplied. Clearing that date while in a submitted status returns 400.

## Documents, interviews, tasks

| Method         | Endpoint                    | Access     | Behavior                                         |

| PATCH / DELETE | `/tasks/{id}`               | C          | Update `{done?,title?,due_date?}` / remove       |

Interview payload: `title,starts_at,ends_at,timezone,state,location,notes`. Dates are UTC ISO timestamps; end must be after start. State is `scheduled`, `completed`, or `cancelled`. Multiple rounds are supported.

Files: PDFs for resumes; PNG/JPEG/WebP for proof. Up to 10 MB/file, 50 files/application, 30 profile PDFs/user. Downloads return attachment disposition and `private, no-store`; storage keys are never public URLs. A `/api/files/{id}` or `/api/profile-files/{id}` link is the authenticated PDF URL for later reference.

Standard job fields: optional `id`, required `title,company,location,description,application_url`, optional `workplace,employment_type,salary,requirements,tags,visibility,active,deadline`. Tags are an array. Workplace: Remote/Hybrid/On-site/Not specified. Employment: Full-time/Part-time/Contract/Internship/Not specified. Visibility: all/assigned. Job editing retains scraper metadata and marks the edited record reviewed. Check publication only after verifying the content.

Scraped import input: JSON array, `{jobs:[…]}`, common `results/items/data` wrappers, JSONL, or complete objects recovered from a pasted array fragment. Map custom paths with, for example, `mapping:{title:"position.name",application_url:"links.apply"}`. Maximum 100 jobs and 2 MB request body. HTML is reduced to text; unsafe schemes/credentials are rejected; source identifiers and canonical application URLs establish identity. Unknown fields remain in bounded source metadata. Mixed search grids and missing required information are held, not published.

The import confirmation never trusts client-supplied normalized records: it processes the original input again. Duplicate imports do not overwrite editorial corrections. Use the job editor or standardized update API for intentional changes. JSON normalizers cannot infer every future scraper layout reliably; unmapped or ambiguous records require staff review.

The current board fetches the visible catalog and paginates rendered rows. API consumers can sort/filter the returned normalized fields. Candidate rankings similarly operate over returned aggregate records. Import history, invitations, inquiry queues, and audit feeds return bounded recent records (100/500/1000/100 respectively); these are operational views, not archival exports.

## Google Calendar and availability

| Method | Path under `/api`                  | Access                  | Behavior                                                                                                                        |
| ------ | ---------------------------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| POST   | `/calendar/google/connect`         | Signed in               | Returns the Google authorization URL; owner-only connection, state cookie and PKCE                                              |
| GET    | `/calendar/google/callback`        | Signed in, same browser | Consumes single-use OAuth state and saves encrypted refresh token                                                               |
| DELETE | `/calendar/google`                 | Connection owner        | Revokes authorization and removes local Google connection/links                                                                 |
| GET    | `/calendar/summary?candidate={id}` | Owner or operator       | Connection health, offered availability, linked event URLs; never tokens                                                        |
| POST   | `/calendar/availability`           | Owner                   | `{job_id?: string                                                                                                               | null, starts_at, ends_at, note?}`; future windows, maximum 24 hours each           |
| DELETE | `/calendar/availability/{id}`      | Owner                   | Removes offered availability                                                                                                    |
| POST   | `/calendar/refresh?candidate={id}` | Owner or operator       | `{from,to}` ISO timestamps, maximum 32 days; returns busy intervals and refreshes up to 100 linked interviews within that range |
| POST   | `/calendar/interviews/{id}`        | Owner or operator       | `{create_meet?:boolean,resolution?:'portal'                                                                                     | 'google'}`; creates/updates a linked Google event or resolves conflicting versions |

Interview PATCH also accepts `{state:'completed'}` by itself. A saved interview edit may return `calendar_warning` if Google sync failed; the local record remains saved and the link's error is visible on the job page. DELETE first removes a linked Google event and rejects if that operation fails. Clients must explicitly connect Google; staff cannot authorize a client's account. No attendee invitations are sent automatically. Read `docs/GOOGLE-CALENDAR.md` for scope, sync behavior, and setup.
